    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and\n",
    "manipulation of the data. \n",
    "It provides a means for storing and organizing large amounts of information in a consistent and structured manner.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model, which organizes data into tables consisting of rows and columns. \n",
    "These databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of SQL databases include:\n",
    "Data Structure: SQL databases have a predefined schema that defines the structure and relationships of the data.\n",
    "ACID Compliance: ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties ensure data integrity and reliability.\n",
    "Relational Integrity: SQL databases enforce relational integrity constraints, such as primary key and foreign key relationships.\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases can handle large datasets and complex queries efficiently.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, and rapidly changing data. \n",
    "They do not rely on a fixed schema and provide flexibility in data modeling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "Flexible Data Structure: NoSQL databases can store data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, wide-column stores, or graph databases.\n",
    "Horizontal Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for distributed computing and can scale horizontally to handle large amounts of data and traffic.\n",
    "High Performance: NoSQL databases prioritize performance over strict consistency, allowing for faster data retrieval and processing.\n",
    "Schema-less Design: NoSQL databases do not enforce a rigid schema, enabling agility and accommodating evolving data requirements.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Amazon DynamoDB.\n",

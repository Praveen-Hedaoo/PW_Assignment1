    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "Measures of central tendency provide information about the central or typical value around which data points tend to cluster. They help describe the \"center\" of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average of all data points. It's calculated by summing up all the values and then dividing by the number of values. The mean is sensitive to outliers and extreme values.\n",
    "Use: The mean is useful for getting an overall sense of the data's central value. For example, calculating the mean exam score in a class provides an idea of the average performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when it's arranged in ascending order. If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers than the mean.\n",
    "Use: The median is useful when there are outliers or when the data distribution is skewed. For instance, in income data, the median provides a better representation of the \"typical\" income since a few extremely high incomes won't distort it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal).\n",
    "Use: The mode is useful for identifying the most common value in a dataset. In a survey of favorite colors, the mode would tell you the color that most respondents prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "Measures of variability describe how spread out or dispersed the data points are around the central value. They help quantify the extent of variation within a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It's a simple measure of variability, but it's sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "Use: The range provides a rough idea of the spread of data. For example, in a temperature dataset, the range indicates how much temperatures vary between the highest and lowest recorded values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance measures the average squared difference between each data point and the mean. A higher variance indicates greater variability.\n",
    "Use: Variance provides a more comprehensive view of how spread out data points are. In quality control, a high variance in product measurements might indicate inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It's in the same units as the original data and provides a more intuitive measure of spread.\n",
    "Use: Standard deviation is commonly used to describe the typical deviation from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates data points are closer to the mean, while a larger standard deviation suggests greater variability.\n",
